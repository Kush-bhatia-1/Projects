# Spotify Song Data Analysis

## Overview
This project represents my first personal endeavor into the world of data analysis, combining my passion for music with a newfound interest in data science. Using Python and various libraries, I delve into the intricacies of what makes songs popular on Spotify. The analysis focuses on understanding trends and patterns within the top 1000, 500, 100, and 10 songs on Spotify for the year 2023.

## Motivation
As a music enthusiast with a keen interest in DJing, I wanted to leverage data analysis to gain deeper insights into the world of music. This project aims to uncover the factors that contribute to a song's popularity and how these factors vary across different levels of success on Spotify.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is 'spotify-2023.csv', which contains detailed information about various songs on Spotify for the year 2023. The dataset includes attributes like song name, artist, popularity scores, and other relevant metrics.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python: The primary programming language for the analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating informative and visually appealing graphs.
- [Other libraries used in the project]

## Analysis Highlights
- Breakdown of song attributes contributing to their popularity.
- Comparative analysis of top songs across different categories (Top 1000, 500, 100, and 10).
- Visual representations of trends and patterns in the data.
